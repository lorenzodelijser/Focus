Check out Focus for Google Docs in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focus-for-google-docs/ehogfddbkbeoadolmjppehadlpkbmfkn)

Focus for Google Docs helps you write better documents by focusing on what matters most. Bring focus back to your writing distraction free without compromises. This extension provides a minimal user interface for Google Docs inspired by iA Writer, Dropbox Paper and Ulysses.

This extension works best when you disable the "Print Layout" option in "View", this ensures texts will flow as intended, without page breaks.
